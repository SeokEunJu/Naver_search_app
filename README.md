# [Mobile App Programing] Personal Project
Get input from the user, then show result in news and blog categories.

## 1. Project Overview

### What API is Used?

When I needed to create an application that utilizes the API, the first thing that came up with is the ["Naver API"](https://developers.naver.com/main/).
Because I use Naver almost every day, I have an affinity for Naver itself.
While searching for Naver APIs, the search API was the most useful, so I chose to develop an app with search API in Naver.
